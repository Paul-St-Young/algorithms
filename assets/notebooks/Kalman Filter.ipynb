    "# Kalman Filter Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman Filter is an algorithm that estimates the state of a stochastic dynamical system at a given time $x_t$ by using noisy measurements $z_t$ of the system. In particular, the Kalman Filter is used when the dynamics of the system can be represented by a linear finite-difference equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_t = F_t x_{t-1} + B_t u_t + w_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_t$ is the state transition matrix, $u_t$ is a control input vector, $B_t$ is the matrix which controls how the input changes the state, and $w_t$ is process noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements $z_t$ are assumed to be linearly related to the state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_t = H_t x_t + v_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H_t$ is the transformation matrix from state to measurement and $v_t$ is the measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman Filter method assumes that $w_t$ and $v_t$ are Gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and covariance matrices $Q_t$ and $R_t$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman Filter algorithm repeatedly estimates the current state based on previous state estimates and current measurements. In particular, the algorithm models the current state's probability distribution as a Gaussian with mean $\\hat{x}_{t|t}$ and covariance matrix $\\hat{P}_{t|t}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure can be though of in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would like to estimate the current state $x_t$ based on past predictions, $\\hat{x}_{t-1|t-1}, \\hat{P}_{t-1|t-1}$. This estimate, which is based purely on the dynamics, we call $\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$. And the estimate for the covariance matrix associated with the state's fluctuations is likewise called $\\hat{P}_{t|t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting the dynamical equation for $x_t$ into the definitions of mean and covariance, we obtain equations for these two estimates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t|t-1} = F_t \\hat{x}_{t-1|t-1} + B_t u_t \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{P}_{t|t-1} = F_t \\hat{P}_{t-1|t-1}F_t^T + Q_t.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to incorporate the measurements $z_t$ taken at time $t$ into our estimate for $x_t$ and its covariance matrix. We invert the measurement equation for $z_t$ to solve for $x_t$. This defines a Gaussian probability distribution for $x_t$ based on the measurement at time $t$. By multiplying this by the Gaussian distribution determined from the prediction step, we get a new combined Gaussian with mean and covariance specified by the current measurement $z_t$ (and their covariance $R_t$) and the past predictions $\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ and $\\hat{P}_{t|t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us, after some algebraic manipulations, the measurement equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t|t} = \\hat{x}_{t|t-1} + K_t(z_t - H_t \\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{P}_{t|t} = \\hat{P}_{t|t-1} - K_t H_t \\hat{P}_{t|t-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K_t$ is the so-called Kalman gain, which has the form\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example 2: Control of orbital trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most successful applications of Kalman Filters has been in the control of trajectories for rockets in space flight missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Kalman Filter itself does not inherently have to do with control theory. As we have described, it simply provides an estimate for a linear dynamic process based on measurements. However, these estimates can be combined with a feedback control system to improve the accuracy and stability of a desired trajectory.\n",

    "#### PID control\n",
    "\n",

    "The idea is very simple. Suppose we have a dynamic process, whose state takes on a value $x(t)$ at a given time. We want to control the system so that the state takes on the value $y(t)$. We do this by trying to minimize the error $e(t) = x(t)-y(t)$. We want to push $x(t)$ towards $y(t)$ as a function of the error. We achieve this through the control (driving force) $u(t)$ which we apply to the system.\n",

    "* You need to have knowledge (or good estimates) for the covariance matrices $R_t$ and $Q_t$. While it may be possible to quantify the noise in your measurement devices, it might be quite difficult to determine the process noise. For physical processes, it could for example be noise due to Brownian motion, which depends on temperature.\n",
    "* The Kalman Filter assumes Gaussian distributed noise. This assumption is what determined the measurement equations, and the form of the Kalman gain. Strongly non-Gaussian noise would likely cause the filter to perform very poorly.\n"
