Good Morning, MS and PhD Engineering Graduate Students

We are writing because you may be eligible for the Siebel Scholars Program Class of 2020. Applications are due by 5 pm on Monday, June 10, 2019. 

To be eligible candidates must meet the criteria outlined below.

The Siebel Scholar receives a merit-based award of $35,000 in the final year of his or her graduate studies. The prize is disbursed without consideration for any additional funding—such as financial aid, assistantships, fellowships, loans, or other awards—that you have already received, or are eligible to receive.

In addition to the monetary prize, winners join the Siebel Scholars community (http://www.siebelscholars.com/), which includes access to a variety of opportunities and events.

Criteria:
    Nominee ranks within the top 10% of their Department of Energy Science class based on academic results.
    Nominee has a track record of distinguished academic merit.
    Nominee demonstrates excellent leadership qualities.
    Nominee has completed at least one year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is reasonably expected to have only one year remaining in the Master’s program, or be in the last year of the undergraduate program in a co-terminus undergraduate and Master’s program (in which case the student should expect to graduate with both degrees within one academic year), or Nominee is a Master’s student in a 16 or 18 month program (either those who have been in the Master’s program for one year and have six months left, or those who have been in the program for six months and have one year left)

The scholarship awardee must be registered and attend classes at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in a degree-seeking program. If a student is not currently enrolled in classes, or transfers, the Siebel Scholars Foundation must be notified by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the award may be rescinded.

To apply, please submit the following materials electronically to Pascal Youakim at youakim2@uillinois.edu : 

1) CV or resume: Please make sure that this includes expected graduation date, citizenship status, employment, and lists of any research publications, leadership positions, and/or entrepreneurial activities.

2) Research statement: (2 page limit, 12 point font). Please discuss past, current, and planned research. In addition, describe your motivation to do research. Where appropriate, please discuss the intellectual merit and the broader impacts of your research (that is, discuss the actual/likely/possible scientific and broader societal contributions of your research).

3) Excellence/Leadership Statement: (2 page limit, 12 point font). This should discuss any notable achievements and/or activities that demonstrate your excellence, but especially those that show your qualities and contributions as a leader. For example, volunteer/community service contributions, student leadership contributions, artistic contributions, and/or involvement in business-related or entrepreneurial activities. (This discussion should include all such activities, not just activities at Illinois.)

4) Your biography: This should be a short statement, 100-150 words in length, written in the third person, and at minimum, describing your research and employment history. (It may be best to think of the biography like a short abstract or executive summary of your case – it will duplicate information from the CV, research statement, and excellence/leadership statement.)

5) Your photograph: A digital, high resolution, color photograph suitable for print publication; preferably a head-shot that is at least 1 megapixel.

6) Complete and return the “Contact Info” spreadsheet (attached). 

7) A letter of recommendation from your adviser or a faculty member who knows you well. The letter should be submitted directly from the letter-writer to Pascal Youakim via email. This letter should attempt to address as many of the following as possible: (a) your research accomplishments, (b) your leadership, (c) your academic performance, and (d) your communications/presentation skills. We recommend that you request this letter as soon as possible since many faculty are, or will be, traveling.

Please provide your materials (1-6) each as a separate document/file, and include your NetID in the filenames (e.g., YourNetID_cv.pdf). The deadline for submission of all materials is Monday, June 10, 2019 at 5 pm.

Be aware that finalists’ materials will be submitted to the Siebel Foundation for a review, and winners’ submitted materials (especially pictures and biographies) may be used as a part of news stories and other publicity related to the award, through both the University of Illinois and the Siebel Foundation.

The target date for the winners to be notified is August 2019.

Thank you and have a wonderful week!
Rhonda


Good Afternoon, Everyone

Please disregard the email that I sent this morning about this Siebel Scholars award below.  We have learned that the wrong nomination packet was given to us.  This award is only for PhD students and the new criteria will be sent to the current PhD students once I receive it.

Thank you and we apologize for any confusion.
Rhonda
