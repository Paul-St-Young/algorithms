subheadline: "Why are physicists doing CS?"
teaser: "The futures of physics and computation are more interwined than ever. Linear algebra and FFT routines transformed our understanding of electronic structure through numerical calculation (DFT&QMC). Ising model and the Boltzmann distribution provide a route to rigorously understanding simple neural networks such as the Boltzmann machine. Physics will eventually eventually transform computation with the advent of quantum computers. We hope to take part in this inevitable evolution by learning and integrating the tthe two fiels."
