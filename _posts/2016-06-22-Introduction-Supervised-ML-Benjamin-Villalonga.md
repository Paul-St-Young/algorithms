subheadline:  "by Benjamin Villalonga Correa"
teaser: "With Supervised Machine Learning techniques we can train a model to be able to recognize and classify inputs such as handritten digits, human faces, objects in a picture or sports teams with high chances of winning a game. One of the most used strategies for doing so is the use of artificial neural networks."

## Presentation Summary
In [this presentation][1], I present:

  * the basic problem setup for supervised machine learning.
  * the classical example of MNIST.
  * a motivation for using neural networks.
  * some easy to code results.
  * some intuition on what a neural network is actually doing.


## Examples
  * Excelent tutorials for examples are given by the TensorFlow [website][2] team.
  * A great (online and free) book on neural networks and deep learning is [Nielsen's textbook][3].

## References
  * [Nielsen's book][4].
  * [Colah's blog][5] has good posts on several topics.
  * [tensorflow.org][2] for a comprehensive library for Python with good tutorials.

### All Machine Learning.
