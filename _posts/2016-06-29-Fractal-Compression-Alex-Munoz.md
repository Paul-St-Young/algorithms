## Presentation Summary
In my presentation, I talk about:

  * the necessary mathematics for fractal image compression.
  * how the algorithm stores information.
  * the implementation of the algorithm.
  * possible applications.
  
## Examples
  * I am going to put up something a bit more pedagogical soon.
 
## References
  * I will move references from my presentation to here soon!
