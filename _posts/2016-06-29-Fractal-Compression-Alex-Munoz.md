title:  "Fractal Compression"
subheadline:  "by Alex Munoz"
teaser: "Fractal compression uses self-similarity in images and functions to reduce the redundant content. This technique takes redundancies and stores them as affine transformations with a set of coordinates."

## Presentation Summary
In [this presentation][1], I talk about:

  * the necessary mathematics for fractal image compression.
  * how the algorithm stores information.
  * the implementation of the algorithm.
  * possible applications.
## Examples

## References
  * I will move references from my presentation to here soon!
