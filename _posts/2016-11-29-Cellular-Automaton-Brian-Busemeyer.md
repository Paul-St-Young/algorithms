teaser: "Cellular automata are simplified simulations that attempt to capture
interesting large-scale behavior, even as the microscopics are artificial, on
the basis of a few well-chosen local rules."

## Presentation Summary
I didn't make any presentation for this, just a bunch of videos.

I implemented and showed Conway's game of life, with some well-known
interesting initial conditions, and built up a preditor-prey simulation to try
to capture some interesting population dynamics.
