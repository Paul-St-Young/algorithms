## Presentation Summary
In [this presentation][1], I present:

  * The conceptual ideas underlying the relaxation technique for elliptic partial differential equations.
  * Some examples showing how relaxation can be used to obtain solutions to Poisson's equation in the presence of a nonuniform charge density.
