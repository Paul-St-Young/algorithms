title:  "Predict Seizure with EEG"
subheadline:  'by Matt Zhang'
teaser: "Seizure can be extremely dangerous in the wrong situations and a lot less harmful with the right preparations. With advances in non-invasive brain monitoring technology such as electroencephalogram (EEG), we may be able to predict seizure an hour before it happens. "
