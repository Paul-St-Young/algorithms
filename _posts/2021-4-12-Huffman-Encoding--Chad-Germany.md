title:  "Huffman Encoding"
subheadline:  "by Chad Germany"
teaser: "Huffman Encoding is a technique of compressing data to reduce its size without losing any of the details. Huffman Coding is generally useful to compress the data in which there are frequently occurring characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code."
