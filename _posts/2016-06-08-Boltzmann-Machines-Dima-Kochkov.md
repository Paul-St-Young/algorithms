title:  "Boltzmann Machines"
subheadline:  "by Dima Kochkov"
Description: "Boltzmann Machines represent a class of Neural Networks that can be used for unsupervised learning. Inspired by ideas from physics and neuroscience these nets allow a simple, genuine learning rule. The learning is based on minimization of Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence between learned probability distribution and the dataset."

## Presentation Summary
[link][1] to pdf

## Examples
* A fairly long python tutorial on RBM [example][8]
* Link to a simplistic c++ [code][7]


## References
* A great course of Neural Networks [Coursera][3] // soon to be removed
* An exact mapping between deep learning and variational RG [RBM-RG][4]
* On Hopfield Nets, [for historic purposes][5]
