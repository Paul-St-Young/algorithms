title:  "Compressed sensing"
subheadline:  "by Brian Busemeyer"
teaser: "Compressed sensing is a way of extracting a full signal out of a sparse sampling. It's only requirement is that the signal has a sparse representation in some basis, which is actually true for most interesting signals that we encounter."

## Presentation Summary
In [this presentation][1], I present:

  * Description of abstract idea of evolutionary algorithms.
  * Some info on why it works.
  * Details of applying it to 1-d bin packing problem. 


## Examples
My compressed sensing [notebook][2] ([html][4]) and related [python library][3].

## References
I just used Wikipedia mostly. 

### All optimization.
