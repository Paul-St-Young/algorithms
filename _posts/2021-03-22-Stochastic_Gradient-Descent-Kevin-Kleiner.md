## Presentation Summary
In [these slides] [1], I present:

  * Context and conceptual overview [2] of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent
  * Brief descriptions of modifications to SGD with visual comparisons [3]

## Examples
  * [SGD_Demos.ipynb] [4] using Kaggle height-weight data [5]
